1. Introduction
App under test: E‑Commerce Demo (Android)
Version: v.3.2.0
Platform: Android (Samsung Galaxy M21 – Android 13, Pixel Emulator – Android 14)
Objective: Validate functional, UI, interrupt, and API behavior of core features (login, profile, catalog, cart, checkout, notifications, permissions).
Scope: Manual testing with API validation (Postman), defect tracking (Jira), documentation (Excel + GitHub).

2. Test Coverage
Total Scenarios: 25
Total Test Cases: 25 (1 per scenario)
Modules Covered: Installation, Launch, Login, Profile, Catalog, Cart, Checkout, Notifications, Permissions, Interrupts, UI, Accessibility.

3. Execution Results
Total test cases: 25
Passed: 16
Failed: 9

4. Defect Summary
Critical: 2
Major: 4
Minor: 3

5. API Validation Results
Login API: Valid credentials returned 200 OK with token; invalid login returned 401 Unauthorized.
Product Catalog API: GET /products returned correct product list; count matched UI.
Cart API: POST /cart/add worked, but quantity update did not reflect in DB (linked to BUG‑03).
Checkout API: POST /checkout returned 200 OK with orderId, but allowed empty cart (BUG‑04).
Notifications API: GET /notifications returned list, but deeplink mismatch (BUG‑05).

6. Risks & Limitations
Limited device coverage (only Android tested, no iOS).
Demo app does not support real payment gateways.
Backend DB not accessible → SQL validations documented as sample queries only.
Push notifications simulated, not real server‑driven.

7. Recommendations
Fix cart calculation logic and checkout validation.
Improve error handling for login and profile inputs.
Enhance UI responsiveness for smaller screens and accessibility scaling.
Ensure notification deeplink consistency.
Add regression testing after fixes.

8. Conclusion
Testing of the E‑Commerce Demo app covered functional, UI, interrupt, and API validation.
16/25 test cases passed successfully.
9 defects identified (2 critical, 4 major, 3 minor).
The app is functional for demo purposes, but improvements are needed in cart, checkout, and notification handling.
