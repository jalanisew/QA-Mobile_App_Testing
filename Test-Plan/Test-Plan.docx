1. Introduction
App under test: Solodroid E‑Commerce Demo (Android)
Version: 3.2.0
Platform: Android (tested on physical device + emulator)
Objective: Validate functional, UI, and API behavior of core features (login, profile, cart, checkout, notifications, permissions).
Scope: Manual testing with backend/API validation using Postman, defect tracking in Jira, documentation in GitHub.


2. Test Objectives
Verify installation and compatibility across Android versions.
Validate functional flows: login, profile management, product browsing, cart, checkout.
Check UI consistency: layout, responsiveness, accessibility.
Test interrupt handling: calls, SMS, background/foreground transitions.
Validate API responses for login, product catalog, cart, and checkout endpoints.
Identify and log defects in Jira, summarize in Bug‑Report.xlsx.


3. Test Scope
In Scope
Functional testing (login, profile, cart, checkout, notifications).
UI testing (alignment, fonts, colors, responsiveness).
Interrupt testing (network loss, background/foreground).
API validation (Postman).
Defect tracking (Jira + Excel export).

Out of Scope
Performance benchmarking (load/stress).
Security testing (penetration, encryption).
iOS testing.
Payment gateway integration (demo only).


4. Test Environment
Devices:
Samsung Galaxy M21
Pixel Emulator 

Tools:
Jira (defect tracking)
Postman (API validation)
VS Code (documentation)

Network: mobile data.

6. Test Approach
Manual functional testing → Execute scenarios step by step.
UI validation → Compare against design guidelines (alignment, color, font).
Interrupt testing → Simulate calls, SMS, background/foreground.
API validation → Use Postman to check endpoints (status codes, payloads).
Defect logging → Record in Jira, export to Excel for repo.
Traceability → Map requirements → scenarios → cases → bugs.


7. Entry & Exit Criteria
Entry: App installed, environment ready, test data prepared.
Exit: All planned test cases executed, defects logged, summary report prepared.


8. Risks & Mitigation
Risk: Limited device coverage → Mitigation: use emulator + physical device.
Risk: Demo app may not support real payments → Mitigation: document limitation in README.
Risk: No backend DB access → Mitigation: include sample SQL queries for recruiter visibility.


9. Schedule
Week 1: Test plan, scenarios, cases.
Week 2: Execute tests, log bugs, API validation.
Week 3: Evidence collection, summary report, repo polish.
